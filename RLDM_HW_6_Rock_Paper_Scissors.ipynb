    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Rock, Paper, Scissors is a popular game among kids.  It is also a good game to study Game Theory, Nash Equilibria, Mixed Strategies, and Linear Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/paste/jzfsa4a37jf4aq/b05d4e6a42d0dc2bc2bce1f2a0097a19cbf364038b8df44793e23d0552f55a52/rps.png width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are asked to compute the Nash equilibrium for the given zero sum games.  You will be given the reward matrix 'R' for Player A.  Since this is a\n",
    "zero-sum game, Player B’s reward matrix will be the opposite (additive inverse) of Player A’s matrix.\n",
    "The first column of\n",
    "the matrix specifies player A's reward for playing rock against player B's rock (row 1),\n",
    "paper (row 2) and scissors (row 3).  The second column specifies player A's reward\n",
    "for playing paper, and the third column player A's reward for playing scissors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to find the ideal mixed strategy for the game. While there are different ways to calculate this, we will use Linear Programming in the hopes of preparing you for your final project. Use the Linear Programming solver CVXPY (<https://www.cvxpy.org/index.html>) to create a program that can solve Rock, Paper, Scissors games with arbitrary reward matrices.  For an example of how to create a linear program to solve Rock, Paper, Scissors, see Littman 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will return a vector of the Nash equilibrium probabilities for player A found by your linear program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your answer must be correct to $3$ decimal places, truncated (e.g., 3.14159265 becomes 3.141).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts explored in this homework are covered by:\n",
